üíª About the challenge
Most of the content available on the internet today can be made accessible only with the correct use of HTML elements.

I received a code with the project developed during Phase 02, but contrary to what was done in class, it does not present the correct semantics.

The page is still working normally but when I opened the code, I find myself with the HTML elements all messed up.... üëÄ
